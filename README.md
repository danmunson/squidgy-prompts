# Squidgy Prompts - Learn Languages with GPT3
Squidgy Prompts are a collection of prompts from [Squidgies](https://squidgies.app) which can be used
to help study languages (with or without the Squidgies app).

They include prompts for:
* Building flashcard decks
    * Deck description
    * Deck vocabulary
    * "Sentence mining" (phrase generation)
    * Fill in the blank "hint"s for cloze exercises
* Short conversation - open ended discussion about a topic to practice speaking
* Vocabularly conversation - discussion about a new vocabulary word
* Grammar correction
* Translation correction - grammar correction plus ensures that the translated phrase is faithful to the original
* Alternative suggestions - suggests different ways to phrase sentences that sound more fluent
* Taboo - a game where AI needs to guess word by having the user describe it
* Twenty Questions - a game where the user needs to guess a word through asking questions
* Explaining the difference between two words or phrases

# Goals

* Support any language
* Prompts should be able to be "completed", although this may not be possible in all conversations (e.g. open ended conversation)
* Prompt responses need to be structured and machine readable so they can be embedded in applications
* Quality while balancing performance - for the most part this means creating a prompt for each language and iterating on it to minimize size (an art, not a science)
