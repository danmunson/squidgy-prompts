Topic: animals
Focus on: Animal conservation

Conservation is the protection and preservation of natural resources, including animals and their habitats.

In the United States, there are many organizations and government agencies dedicated to animal conservation. 

The National Park Service, for example, works to preserve and protect the native wildlife and habitats within the national parks.

Did you know that the bald eagle is the national bird of the United States? It was chosen for its majestic beauty and long life. 

Unfortunately, the bald eagle population was greatly reduced in the 20th century due to hunting and habitat destruction, but conservation efforts have helped to bring the population back.

Another example of successful animal conservation in the US is the American bison. 

Also known as buffalo, these large mammals were once hunted to the brink of extinction, but thanks to conservation efforts, their population has rebounded.

It's important to remember that conservation isn't just about protecting animals, but also their habitats. Without healthy habitats, animals cannot thrive.

Can you think of any specific animal conservation efforts or organizations in your country? How do they compare to those in the United States?
